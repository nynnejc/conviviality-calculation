            The residency creates conditions for joint work by Danish and Russian contemporary
            researchers of cultural phenomena that will engage in joint work online on one
            unifying topic for a period of 5 months. Based on the results of the online residency,
            the residents must submit a jointly developed program of events, an exhibition,
            research results in a public form or in another possible artistic form.
            “Simultaneous actions” refers to a conditional method of parallel potentials and a
            simultaneous flow of research processes. It’s a method of periodic echolocation that
            seeks to clarify the actual happening and a search for a way to expand research into a
            variety of optics.

            The term “Simultaneity” works as a main starting point of the project referring to
            setting up an atmosphere of contemporaneously performed actions in two localities.
            Two areas of communication and interests will be able to be co-present online during
            the development of the project and during it’s publication to expand a given thematic
            topic from different and possibly unexpected points of view.

            Residents from both cities will be able to choose independently the path of their own
            interpretation of the topic and decide which representational means should appear in
            the publication of the project outcome. The residents should seek to combine their
            ideas into a collective research process and project development.

          The platform aims to discuss and practice the principles of “conviviality”, described in the book "Conviviality Tools" by Ivan Illich: to think of this theory from todays as technology, art and media.
          The platform shares the theory (https://nynnechristoffersen.com/conviviality-calculation/html/theory.html) described in the book and propose to practice it with the exercises and instructions.
          The platform aimes to become a place for theoretical and practical experience and exchange between engineers, artists and activists.
