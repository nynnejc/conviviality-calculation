            Our next book club session will be on May 17. This time it is based on the pivotal book from 1973: Tools for Conviviality

            The book reads as a theoretical and practical proposal on how we can repurpose technology as a means rather than an end to 
            realizing ourselves. It is a positive encouragement to share and help each other create systems that are transparent and in 
            return strengthen our ability to build things. It also urges us to rethink a system that places at its center the idea that 
            technology must advance, machines have to take over and that infinite growth and revenue increase is not only possible, but 
            a noble goal in and of itself.

            This book is one of those kinds of works that are quoted over and over. Especially in discussions where optimism and clarity 
            on where we should go with technology is called for. It encourages to look constructively at the mess we've made of our 
            modern world. More busy with building up ideas than tearing down old ones, this is a book that we hope will foster a 
            discussion about the tools of technology and how we can make them our own.

Our focus for this edit-a-thon will be to add biographies of female and non-binary artists to Wikipedia. So do your research before the event, pick an artist (dead or alive) who does not yet have a Wiki page and gather books from the library and articles from the internet (remember it has to be 2nd hand sources!).

You can also participate by reviewing already existing biographies and improving them by adding images or making them more comprehensive.

If you have never edited Wikipedia before, fear not, we have collected some easy-to-follow guides on how to make an account and cheat sheets you can use along the way.

Why do we want to edit Wikipedia?

Wikipedia wants to embody the total democratization of knowledge by allowing ‘anyone’ who wants to, to take part in editing the world’s largest online encyclopedia. 

However, statistics show a very specific pattern in editors. The worldwide Wikipedia Editor Survey from 2011 shows that globally only 9% of Wikipedia editors identify as female. There is no significant gender disparity when talking about readership percentages. 

Having one group of people being overrepresented in any kind of knowledge production or sharing situation impacts the content that is being created and/or distributed. This is very apparent in Wikipedia as well, and it leads to many implicit gendered biases in the content. These are biases such as; topical bias, biographical bias, linguistic bias and an overall lack of different perspectives. You can read more about Wikipedia’s gendered biases on www.yourbiassolutions.com.
